            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>
                The HTML.com team is made up of web developers and technical writers. We all come from different backgrounds, but what we have in common is extensive expertise with all things computers, technology, and the internet.
                
                Some of us had worked with assembly languages years before the web was a thing, and others can’t remember a time when the internet wasn’t practically a human right.
                
                Our team is fully remote like many other modern tech companies. We have writers scattered all over the world in dozens of countries, from Bosnia to the UK to Canada to Australia.
                
                Some of us are nomads; others, not so much. Most of us have never met each other, but we are nevertheless a close-knit team thanks to the wonders of the internet and its collaboration tools.</p>
